slimlock - unholy screen locker
===============================
This is the Frankenstein's monster of screen lockers. I had the horrible
idea to graft SLiM and slock together to create the screen locker that should
have never been.

Slimlock reads your SLiM config files and uses the same interface. If you use
SLiM already, then it should work for you automatically.

If you want to use this, well, don't. It will probably kill all your other
windows. I'm working on it


Requirements
------------
In order to build slimlock you need the Xlib header files.

Running slock
-------------
Use the 'slimlock' command.
